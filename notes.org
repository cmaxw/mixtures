Mixtures

* Overview
Mixtures is yet another fixture thingy, sorta, but meant for large,
composite, sample data sets. You define chunks of sample data, put
them into SQL databases, and when the time comes to build sample data,
these database are mixed together.

1. Everything is done in SQL. No more defining objects in code.

2. Not (necessarily?) intended as a test fixture replacement. Building
   a mixture involves choosing multiple datasets and the order in
   which they will be applied.

So what this thing does is:

- Sets up sample data sets in SQL.
- This lets us have potentially very large "fixtures"
- This lets us modify the fixtures using SQL
- This lets us run schema migrations on our fixtures

* Potential Issues
- What if the schemas are different? Do we tolerate this?
- What if data from one mixture conflict with another? Do we tolerate
  this?

* Design
- Master database that contains database names and mixture
  definitions.

- Each dataset goes into a new *database*. Probably with a prefix like
  mix_ or something? So if you do a show databases on the server with
  the mixtures on it, you might see mix_alex, mix_big_data, mix_foo,
  etc.

* Coolifs
- subtractive datasets? (Cool to write, but... would you ever use it?)
